 README.md Death Prediction AppThis web app allows users to predict their death date based on their personal details, such as date of birth, drug usage, smoking habits, BMI, and exercise levels. The app uses a simple formula to estimate a predicted life expectancy, then generates a random date for the predicted death, along with a countdown timer.Features* Interactive Inputs: Users can enter their Date of Birth, Drug Usage, Smoking Habits, BMI, and Exercise Level to predict their death date.* Dynamic Countdown: After the prediction, a live countdown shows the time left until the predicted death date.* Glowing Text Effect: The app features glowing text for titles, creating a futuristic look.* Animated Buttons: The buttons have hover effects and animation for a more interactive experience.* Fade-in Animation: A smooth fade-in effect for loading elements to enhance the user experience.* Mobile-friendly Design: Responsive layout to look good on various devices (though consider improving with more specific media queries).Tech Stack* HTML: Structure of the page, including forms and buttons.* CSS: Styling of the page, including animations, gradients, glowing effects, and responsive design.* JavaScript: Logic for predicting death date based on user input and generating the countdown timer.* Font: Uses Poppins font for a modern look.Project SetupTo run the project locally, follow the steps below:1.

User Input: The app takes several inputs from the user:o Date of Birth: The user's birth date.o Drug Usage: A score between 0 and 10 indicating drug usage.o Smoking: A score between 0 and 10 indicating smoking habits.o BMI Risk Factor: A score between 0 and 10 based on BMI.o Exercise Level: A score between 0 and 10 indicating the amount of exercise the user does.2. Death Prediction: When the user clicks "Predict Death Date", the app calculates the predicted life expectancy based on the provided values:o The app starts with a default life expectancy of 80 years.o The app subtracts points based on drug usage, smoking, and BMI, and adds points for exercise.o It then generates a random date within the predicted year and creates a countdown from the current date to the death date.3. Countdown: The countdown shows the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the predicted death date. When the countdown reaches zero, it displays a message indicating the predicted time has passed.Customization* Life Expectancy Formula: You can adjust the formula in the script.js file to customize how drug usage, smoking, BMI, and exercise levels affect the predicted death date.* Styling: Modify the style.css file to customize the appearance of the page, including colors, fonts, and animations.Known Issues* Accuracy: The death date is randomly generated based on the user inputs and is for entertainment purposes only. The calculations are not scientifically accurate.* Mobile Responsiveness: While the layout adapts to mobile screens, more detailed media queries might be needed for better responsiveness across all devices.LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.ContributingFeel free to fork this repository, open issues, or submit pull requests.
